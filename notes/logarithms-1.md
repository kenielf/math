# Logarithms - 1
Throught my notes, this is the notation for the logarithmic function:
$$\log_{base}logarithmand = logarithm $$

## Definition
The logarithm is a mathematical function based on the properties of
exponentiation, being its inverse. This means that the logarithm of a given
number $x$ is the exponent to which another number, the base $b$, must be raised to result in $x$.  

The logarithm base 10 ($\log_{10}$) is called the decimal or common
logarithm and is commonly used in science and engineering. There is also a
natural logarithm, using Euler's number ($e ≃ 2.71828$) which is commonly used
for math and physics, and also the binary logarithm ($\log_{2}$) used in
computer science.

### Etymology
The word `logarithm` is formed by the junction of two greek words: `lógos` and
`arithmós`, which respectively mean "ratio" and "number".

## Properties
**01: When the logarithmand is equal to the base, the logarithm will always be
1.**  
$$\log_{a}a = 1 $$
Since $a^{1} = a$.

**02: The log of any base, which logarithmand is equal to 1, will always be 0.**  
$$\log_{a}1 = 0 $$
Since $a^{0} = 1$.

**03: Two logarithms with the same base are equal when the logarithmands are also
equal.**  
$$\log_{a}b = log_{a}c \Rightarrow b = c $$

**04: A power with base $a$ and exponent equal to log of $b$ in base $a$ is equal
to $b$.**  
$$a^{\log_{a}b} = b $$

**05: When the logarithmand is made of a multiplication of numbers, it is
possible to separate them with the same base for both with a sum.**  
$$\log_{a}MN = \log_{a}M + \log_{a}N $$

**06: When the logarithmand is made of a division of numbers, it is possible to
separate them with the same base for both with a subtraction.**  
$$\log_{a}(M/N) = \log_{a}M - \log_{a}N $$

**07: The logarithm of a power is equal to the multiplication of the exponent by
the logarithm of the base of the power, keeping the base of the logarithm**  
$$\log_{a}b^{n} = n * log_{a}b $$

**08: The logarithm of a root is equal to the inverse of the index of the root
multiplied by the logarithm, also keeping the base of the logarithm.**  
$$\log_{a}\sqrt[n]{b} = {1 \over n} * log_{a}b $$

**09: The logarithm of a number, with a base to the power of a some number is
equal to the multiplication of the inverse of the exponent of that base.**  
$$\log_{a^{n}}b = {1 \over n} * log_{a}b $$

**10: The logarithm of a power simplifies itself by multiplying the exponent by
the logarithm, keeping the same base and logarithmand.**  
$$\log_{a}(M^{k}) = k\log_{a}M $$
