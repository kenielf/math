# Logarithms - 1
## Definition
The logarithm is a mathematical function based on the properties of
exponentiation, being its inverse. This means that the logarithm of a given
number $x$ is the exponent to which another number, the base $b$, must be raised to result in $x$.  

The logarithm base 10 ($\log_{10}$) is called the decimal or common
logarithm and is commonly used in science and engineering.

### Etymology
The word `logarithm` is formed by the junction of two greek words: `lógos` and
`arithmós`, which respectively mean "ratio" and "number".
